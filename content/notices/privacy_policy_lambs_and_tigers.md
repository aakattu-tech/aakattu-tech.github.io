This Privacy Policy describes how **Aakattu Tech, LLC** ("we," "our," "us") handles information in relation to our mobile application, **Lambs and Tigers** (the "App"). Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to being transparent about our data practices.

#### **1. Information We Do Not Collect**
The App is designed to be used without creating a user account. We do **not** directly collect, store, or have access to any personally identifiable information from you, such as your name, email address, or phone number. All game progress and settings are stored locally on your device.

#### **2. Information Collected by Third-Party Services (Advertising)**
To support the development and free availability of the App, we use **Google AdMob**, a third-party advertising service. AdMob may collect and use certain data to provide personalized ads. This data may include:

*   **Device Information**: Such as your device's advertising ID, IP address, device type, and operating system.
*   **Usage Data**: Information about your interaction with the ads shown in the App.

This data is collected and managed by Google. We do not have access to this device-level data. We encourage you to review Google's own privacy policy to understand how they handle data:
- [Googleâ€™s Privacy & Terms](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

You can manage your ad personalization settings on your device:
- **On Android**: Go to Settings > Google > Ads.
- **On iOS**: Go to Settings > Privacy > Advertising.

#### **3. Future Features (Leaderboards/Scores)**
We may add features like online leaderboards or score tracking in the future. Should these features require the collection of any personal information (such as a username), we will update this Privacy Policy accordingly and may ask for your consent where required.

#### **4. Children's Privacy**
Our App is intended for a general audience and is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can take appropriate steps.

#### **5. Changes to This Privacy Policy**
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any changes will be posted within the App and on our website.
